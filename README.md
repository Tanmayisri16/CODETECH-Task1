![Alt text](blob:https://web.whatsapp.com/92abcd2b-6699-47bd-aa90-422ab588ac0a)
Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a Java program that allows users to input and manage student grades. The program will handle multiple subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as a letter grade and GPA (Grade Point Average).

Features

The project implements several core features:
Grade Input: The user can input numerical grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
Grade Calculation: The program calculates the average of all entered grades.
Letter Grade Assignment: The program converts the numeric average into a letter grade (A-F) using a standard grading scale.
GPA Calculation: The GPA is calculated on a 4.0 scale based on the average grade.
Result Display: After processing the inputs, the program displays the average grade, letter grade, and GPA for the student.

Program Flow

The user is prompted to input the number of subjects or assignments.
The program then iterates over each subject to collect the respective grade from the user.
After gathering all the grades, the program computes the average.
The average grade is passed through methods that convert it to both a letter grade and a GPA.
Finally, the results are displayed, showing the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.

Conclusion

The Student Grade Management System is a simple yet effective Java program that helps users track student performance by calculating average grades, letter grades, and GPA. It lays a strong foundation for further enhancements such as GUI integration, weighted grading, and multi-student support. The program achieves its core goals, providing a solid, scalable platform for student grade management.
